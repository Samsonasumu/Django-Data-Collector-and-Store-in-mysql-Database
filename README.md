Introduction

This project, mysite, is a Django web application  
Prerequisites

Git (https://git-scm.com/)
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
pip (package installer for Python - usually comes bundled with Python)
Installation

Clone the Repository:

Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/Samsonasumu/mysite.git
```

 
This will download the project's code into a directory named mysite.

Navigate to Project Directory:

```
cd mysite
```

Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the requirements.txt file (which should be present in the project's root directory) and installs all the necessary Python packages for the project to function.

Running the Development Server

Start the Development Server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start Django's built-in development server, typically accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (the exact port number might vary depending on your configuration).
